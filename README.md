Configure a screenshot preview for all your matrix field blocks, giving your clients a better publishing experience.

## Overview

For content-heavy websites, it sometimes makes sense to create a ["content builder"](https://nystudio107.com/blog/creating-a-content-builder-in-craft-cms) in Craft by using matrix fields to define a number of blocks that your client can use to publish content. This is really powerful but also leads to a confusing publishing experience. 

On big sites, you might have 10s of different blocks in a particular matrix field:

When your client goes to publish they'll see a huge dropdown:

There are a number of existing plugins like [Spoon](https://plugins.craftcms.com/spoon) and [Matrix Mate](https://plugins.craftcms.com/matrixmate) that help deal with this but as the number of matrix field blocks grows, even with descriptive block titles it can be tricky to figure out what a block will look like. 

Craft Matrix Field Preview solves this by allowing you to upload screenshots of the rendered blocks so that you client can see at-a-glance what the content they are about to publish will look like. 

When they publish new content, instead of using the native dropdown shown above, they'll get an overlay modal with examples:

As well as a preview on existing blocks.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0 or later.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require weareferal/matrix-field-preview

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings ‚Üí Plugins and click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button for Matrix Field Preview.

## Configuration

Configuration is handled in the plugin settings page.

The first step is to select a volume to hold screenshots assets.

Once saved, you will see a list of all of your matrix blocks from your currently configured fields: ![Configuration step](resources/img/screenshot-4.png)

If you click into any of these, you will be able to add a description of the block as well as upload a screenshot.

Once you have added all your descriptions and screenshots, you're ready to go.

## Usage

Once configured, you (and your client) will now see your previews live when they are editing content. If you go into your entries and click the "add block" of your matrix field, you will see a modal popup with all the blocks for that field alongside your descriptions and screenshots.

You will also get an inline preview for all existing blocks. This inline preview has a hover-over effect that will give the client a larger preview of what the block looks like.

## Caveats

- Configuration of preview fields happens in a custom database table. When you go to migrate your site to staging or production your configuration will not be added be default. You will need to either perform a database dump/restore to ensure the configuration gets transferred, or use another tool to sync your database (like [`craft-remote-sync`](https://github.com/weareferal/craft-remote-sync) for example üòâ)

## Todo

- Improve configuration approach when migrating (see above caveat and [Issue #18](https://github.com/weareferal/craft-matrix-field-preview/issues/18))
